# DICOM Compression Service (DCMTK Wrapper)

A high-performance **Spring Boot–based command-line utility** for performing **JPEG-LS Lossless compression** on medical DICOM images.  
This project follows a **Hybrid Wrapper Architecture**, combining Java’s portability and file system management with the optimized native C++ compression engine provided by **DCMTK**.

The objective is to significantly reduce storage usage **without any diagnostic image quality loss**, making it suitable for clinical and archival workflows.

## 🚀 How It Works

The compression workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Directory Scanning**  
   The Java service scans the user-provided folder recursively to locate `.dcm` files.

2. **Native Tool Invocation**  
   For each file found, Java uses `ProcessBuilder` to invoke DCMTK’s native **JPEG-LS compressor** (`dcmcjpls.exe`) from the local `tools/` directory.

3. **Lossless Compression**  
   The tool applies **JPEG-LS Lossless compression** which provides:

   - ✔ Faster compression speed  
   - ✔ Lower CPU usage  
   - ✔ Better compression ratio than classic JPEG Lossless
   Typical size reduction: **40–70% (varies by modality)**

4. **Atomic File Replacement**  
   The compressed output safely replaces the original file using atomic file move operations to avoid corruption and partial writes.
